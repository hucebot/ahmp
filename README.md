# AHMP: Agile Humanoid Motion Planning with Contact Discovery

This is the official repository for the experiment code of the paper "AHMP: Agile Humanoid Motion Planning with Contact Sequence Discovery" accepted at the 2025 IEEE-RAS 24th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)".

## Abstract
Planning agile whole-body motions for legged and humanoid robots is a fundamental requirement for enabling dynamic tasks such as running, jumping, and fast reactive maneuvers. In this work, we present AHMP, a multi-contact motion planning framework based on bi-level optimization that integrates a contact sequence discovery technique, using the Mixed-Distribution Cross-Entropy Method (CEM-MD), and an efficient trajectory optimization scheme, which parameterizes the robotâ€™s poses and motions in the tangent space of SE(3). AHMP permits the automatic generation of feasible contact configurations, with associated whole-body dynamic transitions. We validate our approach on a set of challenging agile motion planning tasks for humanoid robots, demonstrating that contact sequence discovery combined with tangent space parameterization leads to highly dynamic motion sequences while remaining computationally efficient.

## Docker Installation

### Add coinhsl libraries (optional)
This code requires the HSL_MA97 linear solver internally with IPOPT. If you wish to use IPOPT with another linear solver, you can change the option in the code.
- Obtain an HSL license (free for academic use) from [here](https://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/licensing.html).
- Extract coinhsl.zip folder in ci/ folder.

### Create container image
- `cd ci`
- `docker build -t ahmp`

### Run the container
- `cd [project_folder]`
- `./run_docker.sh'`
